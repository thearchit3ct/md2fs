# Markdown to Filesystem Generator

1. Added support for tree-style notation with characters like │, ├, └, and ─
2. Better handling of comments after # symbols (will add them to the file as a comment)
3. Improved directory detection for the tree-style format
4. Added handling for parent directory creation to ensure files are created properly

Now you can use the script with either:

- Regular markdown list format
- Tree-style format like you provided in your example

## Example Usage

1. Save your tree-style structure in a file like `structure.md`
2. Run the script: `./md2fs.sh structure.md`

The script will create the entire directory and file structure, including empty `__init__.py` files and other Python modules with the commented descriptions you've included in your markdown.
